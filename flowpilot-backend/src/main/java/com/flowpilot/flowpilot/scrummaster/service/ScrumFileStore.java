/**
 * Where attachment bytes live.
 *
 * Being plain about this: the SRS names AWS S3 or MinIO, and this project has
 * neither — no bucket, no credentials, no client library. So this class writes
 * to the local disk of whatever machine runs the backend. That is not object
 * storage and it is not pretending to be: files written here do not survive a
 * container rebuild and are not shared between instances.
 *
 * What it does buy is a narrow seam. Every byte in and out of the module goes
 * through store / load / delete / size and nothing else knows a path exists —
 * the entity keeps only an opaque key, the service and controller never touch
 * the filesystem. Moving to S3 or MinIO later means replacing this one class
 * (an S3 PutObject for store, a GetObject Resource for load) with no change to
 * the entity, the schema, the service, the controller or the API.
